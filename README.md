The Docker Playground is an initiative aiming to provide instructions for building Docker environments to give training and practice environments for educational purposes.

# Contents
* [Getting started](#getting-started)
* [Available Environments](#available-environments)
* [Getting Involved](#getting-involved)

# Getting started
If you're using docker for the first time take a look at the [docker_getting_started](https://github.com/spartaglobal/Docker_Playground/tree/master/docker_getting_started)

# Available Environments

Within the [Environments](https://github.com/spartaglobal/Docker_Playground/tree/master/environments) folder will be various sub-folders relating to particular resources for you to use such as seeded databases, API's and more.

Each subsequent folder per master environment will have `README.md` instructions on how to utilise the particular environment, simply click on the `README.md` for training details and direction to some useful resources to help practice. 

* Databases
    * [MSSQL_Northwind](https://github.com/spartaglobal/Docker_Playground/tree/master/Environments/Databases/MSSQL_Northwind) -> This is a prepackaged environment that contains an MS-SQL Dev server on ubuntu with the Northwind Data set installed for training purposes
    * [MongoDB with seeded data](https://github.com/spartaglobal/Docker_Playground/tree/master/environments/databases/mongoseed)
* Apis
    * [imdb_api](https://github.com/spartaglobal/docker_playground/tree/master/environments/apis/imdb_api) -> This API has been created to utilise the [MongoDB with seeded data](https://github.com/spartaglobal/Docker_Playground/tree/master/environments/databases/mongoseed) which exposes endpoints for the imdb data collection.
