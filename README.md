The Docker Playground is an initiative aiming to provide instructions for building Docker environments to give training and practice environments for educational purposes.

# Getting started
If you're using docker for the first time take a look at the [docker_getting_started](https://github.com/spartaglobal/Docker_Playground/tree/master/docker_getting_started)

# Environments

Within the [Environments](https://github.com/spartaglobal/Docker_Playground/tree/master/environments) folder will be various sub-folders relating to particular resources for you to use such as seeded databases, API's and more.

Each subsequent folder per master environment will have `README.md` instructions on how to utilise the particular environment, simply click on the `README.md` for training details and direction to some useful resources to help practice.
