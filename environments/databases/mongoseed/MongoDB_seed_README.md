# MongoDB Seeded Database

This image has been set up to provide various data collections to allow you to access and practice against a seeded, local MongoDB instance.

# Running the container

The below snippet will get the container up and running locally:

`docker run -d --name <name_your_container> -p 27017:27017 spartagl/mongoseed`

or simply clone this project, ensure you're in the folder `Docker_Playground/environments/databases/mongoseed` and type:

`docker-compose up -d` 

This will create your container for you.

# Connecting to the DB

The DB credentials are as below:

Username = root

password = password

Whether using code or an app such as mongoDB Compass (See below) you will need to connect to the DB using the below connection string:

`mongodb://root:password@localhost:27017`

## MongoDB Compass

To interact with the data within the seeded MongoDB instance you can use mongoDB Compass which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass).

Once you have mongoDB Compass installed you will need to input the connection string stated above.

You should then see the available databases:

![](img/mongoDB_dbs.png)

Select a database, and you will then see the available collection:

![](img/collection.png)

Once you click on the collection you will be able to view the objects available:

![](img/data.png)

You will also see the filter bar where you can begin writing queries too return specific objects:

## MongoDB filter queries
The documentation at [docs.mongodb.com](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/current/query/filter/) are a great place to start learning about filter queries.

# Available collections
At the moment there are 4 different databases that contain collections:
* DB -> imdb; collection -> movies
* DB -> quiz ; collection -> quiz_questions
* DB -> random_user_details; collection -> user_details
* DB -> students; collection -> student_data

for both the `student_data` and `user_details` the data has been randomly generated. The `imdb` and `quiz` data have been taken from public sources.
